# SeminarSelectedTopicsClimateScience


This is my code for the Seminar in Selected Topics in Climate Science. The file InputPreparation is how the input to the Fortran model is prepared. The file plotmypressure takes the output of the model and plots it on a pressure distribution map, so that the distributions can be compared.

The code to the Fortran model has been found and adapted from: https://maths.ucd.ie/~plynch/Dream/Fortran/Model.html
