This directory contains code from https://maths.ucd.ie/~plynch/Dream/Fortran/Model.html

It has been slightly modified, in order to run it and to change the gridsize and the data that is used as input.

The main program is "richie". The executable richie.x
is made by executing the command file "richie.sh"

It may be run as "richie.x > richie.lpt" when the
output will be captured in "richie.lpt".
